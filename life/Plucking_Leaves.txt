I plucked a leaf,
For no reason at all.
"Should I have done it", I paused.
"Will this hurt you", I thought.
"But you've thousands", I reassured.

Some days have passed,
I pluck a few when I am sad,
And a few more just because I can.
One branch has leaves no more.
"But you've hundreds", I scoffed.

A month has passed, Autumn's here.
So disfigured you are, my dear.
This impulsiveness, I'm not letting go.
Every now and then, plucking a few more.
"But they'll all come back in spring", I hoped.

Barely made it past winter, to see the spring.
You're so desperately trying to grow one more leaf.
That I keep plucking off, so indifferent.
Till one day, you didn't do anymore.
"But you never give me your all", I know.
