Every midnight, she starts a stroll
Down the memory lane , by a wall.
Blocking the view of the beach
"What if, what if", her thoughts whisper
She races to the wall to peek over
But she cannot cross over
To the sandy beaches , and the smooth waves
She ends up with the salty sticky wind all over her face

"What if what if", her heart says, as the night falls
She grabs a ball of cotton candy, from a shop, by the road
Less sweet than the sweetness she harbours.
By the warmth in her heart.
The ocean water stays cold and salty forever
