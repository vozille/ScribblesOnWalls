Trying to fly my kite,
But it just wont rise up.
Seeing others fly so high,
Makes me so damn jealous.
Dreams to be in the mile high club
Oh I'm exhausted as fuck.

I used my right hand for twenty minutes
And my left for fifteen,
It got up a bit, when I pulled at it.
But when I stopped to catch my breath,
It fell down flat again.

The gentle winds, I miss,
The way she slowly blows, 
Like a soft kiss.
Blows my kite up and away, 
High into the crimson skies.
Where my kite loves to sway,
Avoiding the bushes in the way.
