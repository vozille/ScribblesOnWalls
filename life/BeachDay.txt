A day at the beach.
The waves by my feet, 
Harbour the temprament of a shy lover.
Hesitantly, it comes forward.
Exchanges a brief glance.
Only to roll back.
Made me turn my back.

The gentle breeze flirting with my hair.
And the sunshine illuminates the golden sand.
I took a seat, sunk my toes in.
Taking me back, to memories, of a distant past.
The sand grains scattered all over me,
Sparkle like I do,
When I am with you.

Scarlet skies and the crimson sun
Paint my skin, in hues of red and pink.
As I feel the warmth fading away,
Just like the day I knew you wouldnt stay.
A starry night awaits.
