A day at the beach.
The waves by my feet, 
Harbour the temprament of a shy lover.
Hesitantly, it comes forward.
Exchanges a brief glance.
Only to roll back.
Made me turn my back.

The gentle breeze flirting with my hair
As the sunshine illuminates the golden sand.
I took a seat, sunk my toes in.
I dug into it, a little, with my hands.
Taking me back, to memories, of a distant pastt.
The sand grains scattered all over me,
Sparkle like glittering stars in the sky.
And it was amidst all this
You captured me.
