Wake me up, it's so soon,
Nine more hours to go till noon.
I have to go on, all alone
Soak up the morning sun
Warms my cold wretched soul up

To the disappointing day that follows,
Never disappoints, at how bad it gets
I pray, and plead, bent down on my knees
May tomorrow be, slightly different.
But yesterday turns up, exactly the same

And the people I meet, let me in , let me go
Based on their needs, it's a little selfish
But that's the way, the world turns.
The way I feel, what I feel, about anything.
Doesn't make the sun set in the east.

Put me down, it's so late.
And too early, for the thoughts,
They will keep me awake.
Till I pass out again, and wake up
To soak up the morning sun
Tomorrow is always a beautiful day.
