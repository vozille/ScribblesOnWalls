To my morning sunshine,
Some months you're warm 
And others a bit cold.
You never left me alone.
Even when the darkest clouds.
Cast shadows over me.

To my sunshine at noon,
You're up so high, and so soon.
Some just cant get enough of you
For others, the luminosity is a curse.
You scatter across the blue skies,
Where the white clouds lazily drift by.

To my twilight sunshine
A dance of the darkness and light,
Where memories are made by the beaches
Amidst the sounds of religious preaches
And discovering the peace, around us, within.

To inevitablies of cold nights,
With the soft pale moonlight, 
Draping over the roses red,
Blooming in the gardens green.
That's where your sunshine's been.
