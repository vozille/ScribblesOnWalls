You glow so warm,
As warm as your words.
You glow so bright,
As the future, infront of your eyes.
You glow so soft
Like the kindness you show and find, in everyone you touch.

You glow like a sunbeam striking,
Your hair a cascading waterfall.
Or like the sand by the beaches
Simmering in dusk or dawn.
Oh you glow, in ways,
My words cannot capture
