You glow so warm,
As warm as your words.
You glow so bright,
As your dreams, in your eyes.
You glow so soft
Like the kindness you show and find, 
In everyone you touch.

The sunbeam striking, your hair
A cascading waterfall, of light and shadows.
You glow like the sand by the beaches
Simmering in dusk or dawn.
Oh you glow, in ways,
My words cannot capture
