To all the sharp edges,
They sting in weird places.
To the eyes, and to touch.
First impressions matter so much.

Buried in a box.
I'm a jigsaw puzzle in a box.
Deep down on a rooftop.
But I hear her footsteps coming closer
Her footsteps are coming closer.
The heart beats go up with hope.

I've been opened up,
On occasional days
And tossed away, after a moment's play
People never stay.

Buried in a box.
I'm a jigsaw puzzle in a box.
Deep down on a rooftop.
But I feel her touch on the cover.
Her soft touch on the rough cover.
The years of dirt, wiped over.

// TODO: this stanza sucks
someone write this please
thought this would be a breeze
I am a lemon tied with chillies
Got squashed under a car's wheels

Buried in a box.
I'm a jigsaw puzzle in a box.
Deep down on a rooftop.
But I see her eyes look at the me.
Her black eyes are sparkling with color.
An unsolved puzzle is gonna get solved.
