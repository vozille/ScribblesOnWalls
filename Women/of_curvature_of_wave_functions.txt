Of the curvature of wave functions.

−ℏ22md2ψ(x)dx2 +V0ψ(x) = Eψ(x) 

The second derivative of a function is called its curvature. 
Paying attention that and, 
the way it is controlled.
By the relative sign of the total energy.
The potential energy at a given point.
It says why a particular wave function
looks as it does.




Oh lady by the beach, 
Your curves glistening in the sun
Vaporising some of that ocean water,
When it kisses the soft skin of yours.
Her soul is uncontrollably unbounded.
Uncensored and beautifully bold.
No wave function can describe, 
The way she looks and does.

Girl you're as raw as quantum mechanics.
