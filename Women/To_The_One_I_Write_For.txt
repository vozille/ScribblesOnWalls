I wrote a poem for you,
Because I thought, you were cute.
But I hardly knew then,
I'd be a better person, 
when I'ld be talking to you.
But anytime I thought of writing to you,
what I really felt.
I held back, I was scared.
Of ruining your beautiful pages,
with stories of my life.

I believed that
You'ld find yourself within me.
But I just couldn't do my best
to lose myself, within you.
I held back, I was worried.
That I'll be talking you back,
back to the places, 
you were trying to escape

After all this time, here I am,
Writing an apology, in misery.
Because you were there all along.
Telling me stories, from the pages long gone.
Asking me to surrender my worries to you.
Asking me to tell you about my happy days.
Listening so keenly, to everything else.

I wrote this poem for you,
Because it's the least I can do.
For the times you were there.
Those times, gone, in a blink of an eye.
Leaving me with a hope, 
Of a future, if the stars align.
A hope to find you there again.
A hope to fill your beautiful pages,
with stories, for a lifetime.
