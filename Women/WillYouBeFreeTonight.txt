Will you be free tonight
I've had this on my mind
Since the hazy twilight
Oh my lady will you be free
I've been asking a lot, you see

Will you be free tonight
It's a cold Christmas eve
You've been working till midnight
All your hopes and dreams 
Bring warmth by your side

Will you be free tonight
My lady with the hazelnut eyes
And the soft sweet smile
let me loose, let lose myself in you
Till the morning sun shines
