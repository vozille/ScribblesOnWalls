To the departed stars,
Lost in the black skies.
Your light still shines.
Guides our sailing ships,
Through the night.

Born from a cloud of dust,
To shine O' so bright,
The essence of life.
The secrets in your heart,
Ended up as part of mine.

To the departed stars,
Long after you've gone.
You will keep inspiring, 
New sets of eyes,
In worlds far beyond mine.
