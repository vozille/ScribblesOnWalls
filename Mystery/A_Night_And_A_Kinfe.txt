Alone, with a knife,
A shadow, cast a silhouette.
The only noise, a clockâ€™s ticking,
Tick tick tock.

Intoxicated, I stuttered on
Contemplated, If I should
Or should not.
And my knife touched.

There was a thrust
Harder than I thought.
A splatter of blood red, opened the insides up.
The pomegranate was worth it all
