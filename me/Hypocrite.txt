The love poems I sent to her.
Were discarded by someone else.
She feels true love, in my second hand feelings. 
While I am chasing after mirages.
I wouldn't even have bothered to write this.
Or talk to a lot of people at all.
If I was busy getting laid.

I love to lie to her.
I love to lay in bed with you.
And the way they mix with truth.
Like some sugar in orange juice.
I'm starting to be a hypocrite.

She calls me a gentleman, she believes I am.
Because I treated her like one.
But I'ld fuck a bride on her wedding day.
If she was available, it's a chance.
Just need to search for an excuse, far enough.
Just need to bend rules, hard enough.
There's always an excuse, rules make way.

I love to lie to you.
I love lay in bed with you.
And the way they mix with truth.
Like some sugar in orange juice.
I'm getting to be a hypocrite.

I tell her how much of a pussy she is,
For holding onto things, from times long back.
While I need a bottle of rum a day, to keep it at bay.
I know I am a mess, I make a mess.
And she decides to stand up, says, "enough of this".
I call her a selfish toxic bitch

I love to lie to her.
I love lay in bed with you.
And the way they mix with truth.
Like some sugar in orange juice.
I'm a fucking hypocrite.
