Hey today, you posted on Instagram.
How close and special these moments are.
But deep down, I'm just another day.
Another mindless day.

Ten o clock in the morning,
I'm going to get a chicken killed for lunch.
But it's okay, my fingers will be licking good.
Because they're not covered in blood.

The green trees block the yellow sunlight.
From the blue skies into my red room.
Where I work every day, on a laptop colored space grey.
While I ponder, what it is about us, I wonder, why
Adversity brings us closer.
Prosperity drives us apart.

You laugh at the outlook of people,
A couple of generations back.
But you'll stop at no end, twisted by vile men.
Avenge the preachings two millennia old.

The gloss you've put on, my girl.
I'm gonna ruin it this evening.
Your lips entangled in mine.
Moisturise all my winter cracks.

Travel to the future timelines tonight,
Near the speed of light
Or follow me and Mr. Penrose's diagram.
Down into the deep dark hole.

You expected another one, didn't you.
Learn to live with your expectations broken
This ending disappointed you, just the way.
You disappoint everyone around you.
