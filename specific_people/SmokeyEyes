Hey smokey eyes.
When you're around.
It makes me smile.
But those moments last.
As long as a burning match.
I look at a chain smoker in envy.
Burning a box of those.

Hey smokey eyes.
It's been a week now.
You're nowhere to be found.
It makes me cry.
I stay up all night.
The dark circles below my eyes.
Are lighter than the current times.

Hey smokey eyes.
You make me smile, you make me cry.
Just like rain with sunshine.
"Is this worth it at all ?"
Too many questions, overhanging clouds.
Make me turn around.
I see a rainbow.
