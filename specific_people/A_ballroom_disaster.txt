--> she says
<-- I say

I bent on my knees, seeing her in advance.
She let out her hand and asked me for a dance.
--> "I hope you move as smooth as you look"
<-- "Hey girl, just tying my shoelace"
She pulled me up from the floor.
With a flick of her hand.
<-- "Bro, you've got a strong core".

Put my arms around her waist, she pulled me close
--> "I love the smell of your cologne"
<-- "Thanks, I borrowed my flatmate's shirt"
I looked into her eyes, I could see it.
That she had worn her favorite grey contacts.
<-- "Hey babe, What's your power of your specs ?"

The seranading music barely kept her interested.
--> "Aren't you the one, you had my heart with your words"
--> "WTF is wrong with you"
<-- "I'm hungry I want food"

She was sweet enough to take me out to a pizza place
I ate 2 slices from her plate
When she was on a washroom break.
I never heard from her again.
