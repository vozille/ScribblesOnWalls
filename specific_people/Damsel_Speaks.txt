Crying myself to sleep, at night.
My unending love for him 
Only served to dull my shine
My eyes drenched in sorrow.
Will wake up tomorrow,
See to the dreams in my soul.

The pain was too much to take.
I walked away, taking all the blame.
My greatest fear, 
Many did not get it.
But I could not live with it.
I could not lose myself.

I want to fly, so high.
Metamorphosise into a butterfly.
See the world with my own eyes.
Be thunder and sunshine.
At the same time.
While the demons inside me.
Keep me away from insanity.

I sat on the riverbanks,
A thought, to chase my dreams.
Like the river chases the sea.
Everyone meant to, will stand by me.
That moment, as it faded away,
Was the last time I smiled.
To hide the pain inside.
