A postcard from a faraway land.
Morning dewdrops on the grass.
Shining so bright, in the faint sunlight.
Like the string of pearls, adoring your neckline.
It's all so beautiful, but I feel incomplete.

Red roses, yellow tulips, purple lillies.
The mingling of myriad scents.
With the songs love birds sing.
Like the prayers you have, for me in your heart.
It's all so beautiful, but I feel incomplete.

Incomplete, my soul, that's missing now.
The one I left with you, in a faraway land.
In an utopian oasis, in which you think I am.
Is a mirage, a dystopia desert.
Where my bones lay bare in the sand.
