I miss you Miss <insert-name-here>.
Every single night, I go to bed.
Thinking about what an amazing day,
It could have been.
If you were a part of it.

In all the dreamy sweetness.
I'm sorry I forgot to respect.
The distance, you need in the present.

I miss you Miss <insert-name-here>.
Every beautiful moment in my life.
Reminds me of your presence.
Your absence feels like a cold void.
I crave the warmth of your kindness.

In all the dreamy sweetness.
I'm sorry I've been pulling you,
Into something you're not ready for.

I miss you Miss <insert-name-here>.
If I am worthy enough for your love.
I need to be ready to let you go.
If that's the thing you wish so.
Because love isn't a cage,
It's the key.
Which sets your heart and soul free.

In all the dreamy sweetness.
I'm sorry I've had too much hope.
And too little patience for your silence.
