One fine night,
She got an exquisite bottle of wine.
Scented candles serenading her senses.
I walk up to her, holding a bouquet of bougainvillea.
She asked me to pour her some wine.
I got lost in her eyes, let some of the fine
wine slip out of the glass.
"I am so sorry".

She stood up , looked me in my eyes.
Let her glance down, let out a smile.
Slid right into my arms, planted her lips on mine.
I lost myself, like Alice in the rabbit hole.
As she let her tongue do all the work.
"Apology accepted", as she slowly parted.

She flicked her long hair, to one side.
Inviting me to explore her gorgeous neckline.
Leagues better over the finest bottles of wine.
Could I feel any more blessed and lucky in life.
"Don't bite me like a vampire", she burst out in a laugh.

We did finish the bottle that night.
Talked about something I don't remember.
I didn't forget the moment she smiled.
It was a pretty long night , she woke up finally.
With the sunlight hitting her sleepy eyes.
I found myself in heaven, snuggling by her side.
