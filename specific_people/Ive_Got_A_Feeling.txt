I've gotta tell you something
Before the night fades away into the dawn.
I've got a feeling I'm falling.
Into something.
Into a world of unknown.
I found you standing by a door
Will you let me in.
Will you walk by my side.
Hands locked together.

I gotta tell you something.
Before these days turn into years.
I've got a feeling I'm flying.
So high, so high my love.
One day it's gonna come crashing down.
And everything will burn.
Will we be scattering the ashes.
Watching them drift up and away.
And re build from the ground up.

I've gotta tell you something.
Before my body is stripped away from my soul.
There's a feeling, I've been failing.
There's a feeling, I've been failing
There's a feeling, I've been failing.
To tell you what's been in my heart.
All along.
