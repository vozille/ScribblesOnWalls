Deep in my sleep,
"Mili Mili Mili", 
A voice whispers slowly.
I have an awakening.
The walls are covered in green
A bougenvaliia dream.

Threw a pebble up to the watery sky.
Watched the stars dance with the ripples.
The moonlight blending with the blackness.
My roots go deep back in time to a moment,
with my favorite cup of coffee.
Which I slowly sipped, looking into your eyes.

The vines were slowly creepeing all over me.
On the pretext of shading me from the sun.
All they did, make me bleed, 
The thorns puncture deep.
Red is both the color of love and the devil.

Strands of my hair, weaved with intricacies
Into the petals of a flower
A blossoming manifestation,
Of the love I found.
The love I had lost for me.

Does it matter,it's all going to end.
Existence is a fleeting breeze, 
But our footprints in time
Will never be blown away.

"Mili Mili Mili", 
A voice whispers slowly.
As I get up from my bed.
I'm sleeping with my eyes wide awake.
