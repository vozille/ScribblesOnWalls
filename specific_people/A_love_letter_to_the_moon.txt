Hi <insert-name-here>,
Your silence is like the night sky.
It's so dark deep and beautiful.
And a little bit painful.
A reminder of the times,
You wore your heart on your sleeve.
Only for it break and bleed.


Your heart is the moon of my night sky.
Without it, it's so dark and cold.
It takes a lot of courage to look up.
And hope one day, the new moon.
Will rise, and grace my life.
I hope you find a reason to,
Believe, that you deserve the best.
I believe, there's always hope left.


I'll not make those mistakes
Made by others before me.

(I'll maybe make new ones instead)
(We all make mistakes we all do)
(It matters how we get over them)
(And I'll never push my insecurities upon you)

In my heart I will always remember.
How precious is the moon.
In the dark deep void of the silent starry skies.
