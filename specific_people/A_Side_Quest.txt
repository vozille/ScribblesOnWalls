She lost her earrings,
On a sultry sunday morning.
She kept them too far away,
Never to be seen again.
But she never loses,
The people in her heart
My lady, she is distracted.
So so distracted, 
By a side quest.

She washed her hair in the morning,
For the fumes of the boiling chicken broth
To mess it up all over again
She's gonna do it all over again.
But she's never messing around
Her dreams, and her goals
My lady, she is flustered
So so flustered
By a side quest

She's got the sanskaari sarees
Nice disguise, for that dirty mind.
A girl drunk in journey of life.
And the charm, the wit, and the soul.
And those eyes, the blushes and cheese
Fisheries and fermented fantasies.
My lady, she is special
So so special
Our special side quest
